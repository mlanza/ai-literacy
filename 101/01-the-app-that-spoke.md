# The App That Spoke

It started with a prompt box and a blinking cursor. Ask it anything, people said — so they did.

Within days of its release in late 2022, ChatGPT was composing poems in Shakespearean English, debugging Python code, writing bedtime stories on demand, and helping students understand quantum mechanics “as if they were five.” It passed parts of the bar exam, drafted resumes and cover letters, and sparked debates in boardrooms and classrooms alike. Over 1 million people signed up within five days. By January 2023, it had 100 million users — the fastest consumer product growth in history at the time.

What made ChatGPT so compelling wasn’t just what it could do — it was how easily it did it. It made powerful AI feel personal. No training, no manuals, no menus. Just type, and it responds. You could hold a conversation with it.

Beneath that clean, chatty surface lies something extraordinary: a large language model, or LLM. It’s not ChatGPT that’s doing the heavy lifting — it’s the LLM inside, trained on massive amounts of text and capable of generating coherent, human-like responses based on patterns in language. ChatGPT is simply an interface — an app built around an LLM.

In this chapter, we’ll focus on understanding LLMs through the lens of ChatGPT. It’s not the only chatbot, but it’s the one that put LLMs into the public imagination. As we explore what these models are and what they make possible, we’ll use the term “chatbot” generically — but we’ll use ChatGPT as our guide. After all, it’s as good a framework as any for understanding what AI offers us today.
