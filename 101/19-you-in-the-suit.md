# You in the Suit

Think about Tony Stark.

Without the Iron Man suit[^1], he’s brilliant, resourceful, maybe a little reckless — but still just a guy. And without Tony Stark inside, the suit is just a machine. It can fly around, sure. It can run autopilot routines, maybe even save the day in a pinch. But it's not the same. The real power comes from the **combination** — a skilled human using a powerful tool.

That’s what it’s like using ChatGPT.

On its own, it can generate language, suggest ideas, write code, summarize complex topics. It’s fast. It’s capable. Sometimes, it feels like magic. But it doesn’t *know* what matters. It doesn’t understand your goals, your context, your values. That’s your job.

And without it, you're still sharp, experienced, thoughtful. But now you’ve got access to skills you didn’t naturally have — encyclopedic recall, tireless drafting, code generation, summarization at scale. Not because the machine is replacing you — it’s **extending** you.

It’s a collaboration.

Imagine Will Hunting had been hired onto a team. You wouldn't put him in charge of everything. You’d pair him with someone who knew how to frame problems, challenge assumptions, translate insights into action. He’d be invaluable under wise supervised use. Left alone, he might get lost in abstraction. But paired with the right partner? Game-changing.

That’s AI.

It’s not here to replace human intelligence. It’s here to **amplify** it — to become part of your workflow, your toolkit, your team. But it needs someone inside the suit. Someone to guide, to filter, to decide.

So the question isn’t “Will AI take my job?”

It’s “What can I do in the suit?”

Don’t lose track of this: **the suit doesn’t amplify you by accident.** To really make it part of who you are, you have to learn its ins and outs. You have to fly it around, try the gadgets, push it to its limits, and make a habit of bringing it into your real work. The abilities are there — but they’re latent. They emerge only when you’ve put in the hours, tested the edges, and decided to suit up regularly.

That same pattern will hold for every step ahead. Later, you’ll see the AI not just as an amplifier, but as a teammate. Later still, you’ll see it as a way to assemble and coordinate whole teams. Each stage is a learned skill — a capability that only shows up because you invested the energy to develop it.

It’s no different than learning the piano or advancing in karate. The power isn’t in owning the instrument — it’s in the hours you’ve spent with it, the comfort that comes from daily use, the confidence that comes from knowing what it can do in your hands.

AI won’t much amplify those who treat it casually. But for those who put in the effort to harness it by training with it, learning from it, and making it part of their muscle memory — the gains can be extraordinary.

The suit will take you farther.

But only if you choose to wear it.
