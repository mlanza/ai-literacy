# More Than Vending Machines

Think of each model as a coworker you’ve met just once. You might know their résumé, but you don’t yet know how they like to work. Some thrive on clear bullet points. Some respond better to examples. Some default to brevity unless you spell out the need for depth. And that’s before you factor in their quirks — the subtle ways their training data, tuning, and built-in safety constraints shape how they interpret your requests.

It’s tempting to believe you can simply “shop” your prompt around — paste the same ask into different models and let their randomness produce something fresh. That can work for ideation, but it’s a shallow strategy if you’re trying to build reliable process. A prompt that sings in one model might flop in another, not because the second model is weaker, but because you haven’t yet learned how to speak its language. Each one has its own sweet spots, its own tolerance for ambiguity, its own ways of signaling when it needs more to go on.

These models can be slotted into jobs just like coworkers — given a defined role, a set of expectations, and the right materials to succeed. And just like coworkers, they’re more than vending machines. You don’t get consistent, high-quality work by pushing a button and expecting something flawless to land in the slot, shrink-wrapped and ready to go. You get it by understanding how they operate, giving them the right context, and shaping your requests so they can deliver the result you actually need.

One process tuned for one model might stumble when you swap in another. That doesn’t mean the new one is worse — in fact, it might be sharper if you meet it on its terms. The trick is to notice those terms, adapt your inputs, and capture what works so you can reuse it.

The pitfalls of skipping that learning curve show up fast:

* **Process drift** — Swap in a new model and your once-tight workflow produces messy or off-brand results, because the cues that worked before aren’t the ones this model responds to.
* **False negatives** — You assume the model **can’t** do something because it struggled under your old prompt, when in reality a different approach would unlock better output.
* **Invisible mismatches** — You keep getting answers that are technically correct but miss the tone, format, or nuance you expected, because the model weighs those factors differently.

And just as we’ve seen earlier, people respond to more than just a model’s accuracy — they respond to how it feels to work with. Each one has its own conversational rhythm, tone, and quirks. Models aren’t interchangeable parts, and they’re more than vending machines. If you want better results, see them as coworkers — and just as you’d learn and adapt to the temperamental quirks of your human teammates, be willing to do the same with different models.
