# What If You Had Einstein?

Imagine that. Einstein, on call. Not the man himself—but a model shaped by that kind of mind. Tuned to see what most of us miss. If only.

It’s an audacious idea. My word. But it points to something real. Models aren’t people—they’re built things. Trained to think in certain ways. To notice what others overlook.

Some are generalists, useful across a hundred tasks. Others are specialists—tuned for legal reasoning, scientific discovery, or even writing poetry. Some are fast and lightweight, built to run on your phone. Others are massive, built to run in data centers and tackle enterprise-grade tasks.

They don’t all think the same. It depends on what they were made for.

So don’t just ask *what can this model do?* Ask *what was it built for?*

You’re not conjuring brilliance out of nowhere. You’re choosing the right mind for the work.

And with the way training is going, you may soon be getting a genius-level thinker—a master of a domain—all the same.
