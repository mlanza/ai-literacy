# What If You Had Einstein?

Now stretch that thought further. What if you had a model that reflected Einstein’s way of seeing the universe? Imagine that. Einstein, on call. Not the man himself—but a model shaped by that kind of mind. Tuned to see what most of us miss. If only.

It’s an audacious idea. My word. But it points to the reality that each is built to think in certain ways. And while “Einstein” makes the picture sharp, it could just as well be Curie, Ada Lovelace, James Baldwin—any number of singular minds history has known.

In that sense, these models are like recruits, each with distinct strengths. You don’t hire the genius for every job; you consider the variety in the talent pool.

Some are generalists, useful across a hundred tasks. Others are specialists—tuned for legal reasoning, scientific discovery, or even writing poetry. Some are fast and lightweight, built to run on your phone. Others are massive, built to run in data centers and tackle enterprise-grade tasks.

They don’t all think the same. Mind what they’re made for.

You’re not conjuring brilliance out of nowhere. You’re matching the mind to the work. And picking the right model—like picking the right expert—can be the difference between a decent answer and an outstanding one.
