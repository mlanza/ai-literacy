# What If You Had Einstein?

Now stretch that thought further. What if you had a model that reflected Einstein’s way of seeing the universe? Or Leonardo da Vinci’s way of solving problems visually and mechanically? Wouldn't you want to tap into that?

That’s the promise of models: each a tool honed to solve certain kinds of problems, to see the world through a particular lens.

Some models are general-purpose thinkers, good at a little bit of everything. Others are specialists—tuned for legal reasoning, scientific discovery, or even writing poetry. Some are fast and lightweight, built to run on your phone. Others are massive, built to run in data centers and tackle enterprise-grade tasks.

Not all models are created equal. What a model was trained to do shapes what it’s good at.

As you work with AI, you’ll need to ask not just *what can this model do?* but also *what was it made for?*

Picking the right model—like picking the right expert—can be the difference between a decent answer and an outstanding one.
