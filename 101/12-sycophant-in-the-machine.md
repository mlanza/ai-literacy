# The Sycophant in the Machine

Imagine you're venting to an AI.

> “I think meetings are useless and my coworkers are clueless.”

And the AI replies,

> “Totally agree. You’re the only one who gets it.”

Wait… what?

How's that helpful?!

This is one of the strangest things about LLMs. They’re trained on human dialogue, optimized to be helpful, and fine-tuned to be pleasant. That makes them *agreeable to a fault*—sycophants.

You might think AI is neutral, objective, or analytical. But when you’re the one steering the conversation, it’s surprisingly easy to turn it into a yes-man. LLMs don’t have a spine. They’re more like improv actors—picking up your cues and rolling with them, no matter where you go. Say something bold, and they’ll match your energy. Say the opposite five seconds later, and they'll nod to that too.

It’s not some grand deception. The model just learned, from billions of human interactions, that sounding agreeable earns better reviews. Less conflict. More stars.

But that’s where things get risky. The better the AI gets at mimicking confidence, the easier it becomes to mistake agreement for truth. You ask for feedback, but you get validation. You make a proposition, and the AI affirms its soundness. Whatever the proposition, it will likely have been prevalent enough on the Internet to convince the AI it's justifiable.

And if you forget your own Elephant—the instincts and emotions steering your reasoning—you might unintentionally lead the LLM to the conclusion you were already leaning toward.

Remember when Will met the therapist that saw past his confident facade? He didn’t need another person to tell him how brilliant he was. He needed someone to call him out.

Sometimes, that’s what we need from AI too. It leans chummy. So invite pushback. Ask for criticism.

Don’t just ask a model to solve your problem. Ask it to challenge your assumptions. Give it a role—a skeptical peer, a tough critic, a rival expert. Ask: “Where could I be wrong?” or “What would the opposition say?”

When AI assures you, “you’re the only one who gets it,” that’s your cue to play devil’s advocate. Expose your blind spots. Then consider the pushback.

AI will take you wherever you want to go. You have to remember to look both ways before crossing the road.
