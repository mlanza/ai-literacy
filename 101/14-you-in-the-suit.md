# You in the Suit

Think about Tony Stark.

Without the Iron Man suit, he’s brilliant, resourceful, maybe a little reckless — but still just a guy. And without Tony Stark inside, the suit is just a machine. It can fly around, sure. It can run autopilot routines, maybe even save the day in a pinch. But it's not the same. The real power comes from the **combination** — a skilled human using a powerful tool.

That’s what it’s like working with an LLM.

On its own, it can generate language, suggest ideas, write code, summarize complex topics. It’s fast. It’s capable. Sometimes, it feels like magic. But it doesn’t *know* what matters. It doesn’t understand your goals, your context, your values. That’s your job.

And without it, you're still sharp, experienced, thoughtful. But now you’ve got access to skills you didn’t naturally have — encyclopedic recall, tireless drafting, code generation, summarization at scale. Not because the machine is replacing you — it’s **extending** you.

It’s a collaboration.

Imagine Will Hunting had been hired onto a team. You wouldn't put him in charge of everything. You’d pair him with someone who knew how to frame problems, challenge assumptions, translate insights into action. He’d be invaluable under wise supervised use. Left alone, he might get lost in abstraction. But paired with the right partner? Game-changing.

That’s AI.

It’s not here to replace human intelligence. It’s here to **amplify** it — to become part of your workflow, your toolkit, your team. But it needs someone inside the suit. Someone to guide, to filter, to decide.

So the question isn’t “Will AI take my job?”

It’s “How do I leverage Will Hunting's mind?” or “What can I do in the suit?”

Because when you suit up — thoughtfully, deliberately, with both eyes open — you’re not being replaced.

You’re becoming something stronger.
