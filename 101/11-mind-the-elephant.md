# Mind The Elephant

Here’s something wild: you can justify almost anything.

You might not believe that at first, but once you understand how your brain works, it becomes obvious. You, like everyone else, are walking around with what psychologist Jonathan Haidt calls an Elephant and a Rider inside your head.

The **Elephant** is your gut — your instincts, emotions, moral reflexes, your “I just feel like it” side. The Rider is your reasoning mind — the part of you that explains, defends, and tries to make sense of what the Elephant already decided.

The **Rider** likes to *think* he's in charge. He makes charts, writes arguments, sets alarms, builds philosophies — but in most moments when the Elephant leans and then veers in a direction, the Rider finds the reason it makes sense to go that way.

That’s not a flaw — it’s a feature of being human. The mind often justifies what the heart wants. We’re not cold, calculating logic machines. We’re **meaning-makers** who lead with intuition and then bolt on a clean explanation afterward.

Psychologists call the force that drives this dynamic **cognitive dissonance** — the tension we feel when our beliefs, values, or actions come into conflict. That tension is uncomfortable. And because no one likes living in a state of internal contradiction, the mind works to restore harmony. We rationalize not just to persuade others, but to make peace with ourselves.

And that instinct serves us — because life isn’t simple. It’s full of nuance, edge cases, and changing contexts. We’re constantly navigating situations where the “right” answer depends on more than just the rule. Black-and-white thinking breaks down fast.

Think about lying.

If I asked you, “Is it okay to lie?” you’d probably say no.

But what if you were hiding someone in your home? When the shooter bursts in demanding their whereabouts, what do you say?

You lie, of course.

Not because you changed your mind about lying, but because the context changed — and with it, your sense of what matters most. The emotional stakes shifted. The logic reassembled itself. And just like that, a once-firm principle made room for a higher priority.

And that’s the deeper truth behind it all: **almost any belief or action can be justified, given the right values and situation.** What feels like contradiction is often just a shift in context. “It depends” isn’t a cop-out — it’s a reflection of how humans actually work. And that has consequences when you're talking to an AI. Large language models don’t have a fixed stance or a moral compass. They sample language, not truth. So now and then, they’ll generate something that rubs you the wrong way — not because they’re wrong, but because they’re channeling a messy, conflicted world. And baked into that mess is the Elephant — our moral instincts, gut reactions, and emotional logic — expressed again and again in a billion different voices.
