# Mind The Elephant

Here’s something wild: you can justify almost anything.

You might not believe that at first, but once you understand how your brain works, it becomes obvious. You, like everyone else, are walking around with what psychologist Jonathan Haidt calls an Elephant and a Rider inside your head.

The **Elephant** is your gut — your instincts, emotions, moral reflexes, your “I just feel like it” side. The Rider is your reasoning mind — the part of you that explains, defends, and tries to make sense of what the Elephant already decided.

The **Rider** likes to *think* he's in charge. He makes charts, writes arguments, sets alarms, builds philosophies — but in most moments when the Elephant leans and then veers in a direction, the Rider finds the reason it makes sense to go that way.

That’s not a flaw — it’s a feature of being human. The mind often justifies what the heart wants. We’re not cold, calculating logic machines. We’re **meaning-makers** who lead with intuition and then bolt on a clean explanation afterward.

Psychologists call this dynamic **cognitive dissonance** — the tension we feel when our beliefs, values, or actions come into conflict. That tension is uncomfortable. And because no one likes living in a state of internal contradiction, the mind works to restore harmony. We rationalize not just to persuade others, but to make peace with ourselves.

And that instinct serves us — because life isn’t simple. It’s full of nuance, edge cases, and changing contexts. We’re constantly navigating situations where the “right” answer depends on more than just the rule. Black-and-white thinking breaks down fast.

Think about lying.

If I asked you, “Is it okay to lie?” you’d probably say no.

But what if you were hiding someone in your home? When the shooter bursts in demanding their whereabouts, what do you say?

You lie, of course.

See? The principle didn’t change — *your Elephant just moved*. The emotional stakes shifted, the context changed, and your internal justifications caught up. Your Rider kicked in with logic about protection, greater harm, and moral responsibility. It’s not just an exception to the rule — it’s a reminder that **the rule always had caveats**, whether you were aware of them or not.
