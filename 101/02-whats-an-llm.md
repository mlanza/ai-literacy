# What’s an LLM?

At a high level, a large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence trained to predict and generate human-like text. You give it a prompt — a question, a sentence, even just a phrase — and it responds based on patterns it learned from analyzing vast amounts of language: books, articles, websites, conversations.

It doesn’t “know” things the way people do. It doesn’t have beliefs, opinions, or consciousness. But it does have an uncanny ability to recognize structure, context, and nuance in language. And from that, it can produce text that sounds natural, thoughtful, even creative.

Think of it like a sophisticated auto-complete — not just finishing your sentence, but continuing your thought in surprisingly coherent and useful ways. And now and then, it’ll carry out a task so thorough or apt you might catch yourself wondering how. Not because it “knows” — it doesn’t — but because it’s working, like a person would, on your behalf.

So when you’re chatting with ChatGPT, you’re really engaging with an LLM behind the scenes. That’s the brain. The rest — the friendly interface, the name, the personality — is just how it gets delivered to you.
