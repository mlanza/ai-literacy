# Iteration Facilitates Human Thinking

Why iterate?

Because we’re human.

We rarely think of everything up front. We forget key details. We realize too late what we should have asked. Sometimes we discover midstream that we’re solving the wrong problem entirely.

We don’t iterate because the model requires it. We iterate because it helps us think, helps us figure out what we actually need. The back-and-forth lets us pilot the suit, testing what it can and can’t do. In theory, if we knew exactly what we wanted and how to say it, we could get the response we needed in one shot.

But we don’t — and the ChatGPT developers anticipated this. They built for that reality, for humans who think best by trying, adjusting, and trying again.
