# Table Stakes

Picture AI as a ladder. The first rung is where we stand now: generative systems that can draft, analyze, and create at a pace no human team could match. The next rung is AGI — machines that could adapt across tasks with human-like versatility. Beyond that is superintelligence, where capability exceeds our own entirely.

Those higher rungs matter, but they aren’t the point here. What matters is that the lowest rung has already changed the rules. Companies are reorganizing around AI. Teams that learn to work with it are moving faster and reaching further. The disruption isn’t waiting for AGI — it’s happening now.

Even if the ladder stopped here, the stakes would be enough. Tomorrow’s workforce will be shaped by people who grew up with AI as part of their toolkit. Competing without it will feel like competing without the internet — possible, but increasingly costly.

That’s why the call isn’t to speculate about superintelligence. It’s to adapt now. Learn the tools. Experiment with them. Don’t rule them out just because they’re unfamiliar. The advantage belongs to those willing to put AI to work — and the gap between those who do and those who don’t is already widening.
