# LLMs Sound Almost Human

Once you understand that an LLM is a fixed snapshot of neural networks—it’s natural to ask: *Why does it feel so human?*

This brings us to one of the most striking metaphors in recent AI discourse. Andrej Karpathy, one of the key minds behind Tesla Autopilot and a major voice in the AI field, said[^1]:

> *“LLMs are like people spirits—uncanny simulations of human intelligence with encyclopedic memory, but weird psychological quirks.”*

That's not poetic, but practical. The reason LLMs seem human is not accidental. Their entire “mind” (that is, their neural network) is shaped through exposure to human communication. Every blog post, research paper, poem, argument, legal document, and conversation used in their training was written by people. So their model of the world isn’t built from first principles like a physics engine—it’s built from *our* language, *our* stories, *our* emotions, *our* logic, and *our* contradictions.

Their “brain” is a massive mathematical structure tuned to predict the next word a human might say. And to do that well, it had to absorb our styles of reasoning, our preferences, our rhetorical tricks, and yes—even our quirks. That’s why an LLM can sound insightful, snarky, anxious, confident, humble, poetic, or passive-aggressive. It’s a compressed remix of humanity.

There's a shadowy side to that reality. Models aren’t just trained on people at their best. They’re trained on mountains of information too vast to properly curate. And in those pools of information are outdated assumptions, misinformation, harmful tropes, biased viewpoints, and plain old human error. If people have written it — and especially if they've written a *lot* of it — there's a good chance the model absorbed it through sheer exposure.

So while an LLM is neither conscious nor malicious—and it doesn’t “know” anything—it behaves in the spirit of the people from which it took its imprint. It was trained on our reflections of reality, and in doing so, it absorbed our fingerprints, our biases, our obsessions, and our beauty.
