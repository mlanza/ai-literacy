# AI Literacy Onboarding

This is an AI literacy course aimed at helping someone with a passing understanding of AI. The reader is someone who has used ChatGPT or a similar chatbot, but doesn’t have deep training or technical background. They know what a prompt is.

The course ascends through three incremental stages:

* [101: Large Language Models](./101/)
* [201: Practical Application](./201/)
* [301: Systems Thinking](./301/)

It’s not meant to provide a replete understanding of everything one might use an AI to do, nor all the advanced prompting techniques one might explore. That can be pursued independently. Rather, it aims to build a holistic mental framework for understanding AI — and, more importantly, how to think about leveraging it.

I’m not an AI expert by trade. What you’ll find here comes from putting in a colossal amount of effort to absorb the beginner and intermediate material and make sense of it in practical terms. This is an attempt to bring others up to a similar understanding — not by translating research papers, but by building an intuitive foundation that holds up across use cases.

In the process, I’ve started to see just how remarkable the technology can be. Some of the potential use cases are genuinely surprising — not because they’re flashy, but because they’re useful in ways that change how we work and think. What’s been more surprising, though, is how that spark doesn’t always catch. That’s part of why I wrote this. I wanted to lay down a framework to help others see what I’m seeing — to make sense of why this matters.

You’ll see ChatGPT referenced throughout, since it’s a widely accessible and concrete entry point. But this isn’t about one tool. The ideas here are meant to be platform-agnostic and useful no matter which system or interface you’re using. The references to ChatGPT are there to help make things easier to imagine. The underlying principles apply broadly — because in the modern era, AI often means anything built on the new underlying primitive: the large language model, or LLM.

I know there are deep and ongoing ethical questions surrounding AI. This work doesn’t engage with them. The focus here is strictly utilitarian — how the systems behave, how to reason about their capabilities, and how to use them well.

It’s also a work in progress. Major revisions may still come. I’ll clearly mark when I consider it stable and ready for broader consumption.

Thanks for taking the time. I hope what’s here proves useful.
