# AI Literacy Course

This is an AI literacy course aimed at onboarding someone with a passing understanding of AI. The reader is someone who has used ChatGPT or a similar chatbot, but doesn’t have deep AI training. He knows what a prompt is.

The course ascends 3 stages:

* [101: Large Language Models](./101/)
* [201: Practical Application](./201/)
* [301: Systems Thinking](./301/)

It’s not meant to provide a replete understanding of everything one might use an AI to do, nor all the advanced prompting techniques one might explore. That can be pursued independently. Rather, it aims to build a holistic mental framework for understanding AI — and, more importantly, how to think about leveraging it.

Though I am a proficient developer, I’m not an AI expert. What you’ll find here comes after putting in a colossal effort into absorbing beginner and intermediate materials.  It attempts to make sense of it in practical terms, to bring others up to a similar understanding, and build on fundamentals that hold up across use cases.

In the process, I’ve started to see just how remarkable the technology can be. Some of the use cases are surprising because they challenge how we work and think. What’s been more surprising, though, is how that spark doesn’t always catch. That’s part of why I wrote this. I wanted to help others see why I find LLMs so compelling.

You’ll see ChatGPT referenced throughout, since it’s a widely accessible and concrete entry point. But this isn’t about one tool. The ideas here are meant to be platform-agnostic and useful no matter which system or interface you’re using. The references to ChatGPT are there to help make things easier to imagine. The underlying principles apply broadly — because in the modern era, AI often means anything built on the new underlying primitive: the large language model, or LLM.

I know there are ethical questions surrounding AI. This work doesn’t engage with them. The focus here is strictly utilitarian — how the systems behave, how to reason about their capabilities, and how to use them well.

It’s also a work in progress, mostly first-draft material in need of editing. I’ll clearly mark when I consider it stable and ready for broader consumption.

Thanks for taking the time. I hope what’s here proves useful.
