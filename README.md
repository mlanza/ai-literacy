# AI Literacy Onboarding

This is an AI literacy course aimed at helping someone with a passing understanding of AI.  The reader is someone who has used ChatGPT or a similar chatbot, but otherwise no extensive AI training or understanding.  He knows what a prompt is.

The course ascends 3 incremental stages:
* [101: Large Language Models](./101/)
* [201: Practical Application](./201/)
* 301: Systems Thinking

It's not meant to provide a replete understanding of everything one might use an AI to do, nor all the advanced prompting techniques one might use.  That can be learned independently.  Rather, it aims to build a wholistic mental framework for understanding AI and, more importantly, how to think about leveraging it.

It generalizes the discussion to ChatGPT, but the framework imparts is transitive and not meant to promote a single product.  The concrete context permits more concrete illustrations.  That is all.  It makes things easier to imagine.  The principles apply widely to all AI, since AI in the modern era is any app which leverages the new primitive behind artificial intelligence: the large language model or LLM.
