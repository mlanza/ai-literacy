# Notes

I've written perhaps 2/3rds of what I had planned. The [Text Adventures](./301/05-text-adventures.md) chapter is a simplification, but not by much.  I still need to explain how the app layer facilitates LLM actions.  That's coming.

The [Craft](./301/06-craft.md) chapter was a detour.

At least a handful of other chapters are loosely planned.
