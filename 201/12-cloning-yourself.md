# Cloning Yourself

## The Dilemma of Doug Kinney

In the 1996 comedy *Multiplicity*, Michael Keaton plays Doug Kinney, a frazzled construction manager whose life is unraveling under the weight of work, family, and constant demands on his time. When a scientist offers him the chance to clone himself, Doug jumps at the opportunity. Finally, he can be in two places at once. As the story unfolds, Doug doesn’t stop at one clone—he creates multiple. Each new version of himself is a little different, a little more eccentric, and a little less capable than the original. But the motivation behind it is unmistakably human: **he wants help that thinks like he does.**

That’s the fantasy AI now makes real—up to a point.

Unlike Doug’s literal clones, AI doesn’t actually replicate your intelligence. It doesn’t share your goals, retain your memory over time, or understand your values. But with the right input—well-structured specs, examples, tone guides—you *can* shape it to behave like a highly attentive, always-on version of yourself. Not a clone of your mind, but a clone of your methods.

## From Piloting a Suit to Mentoring a Team

Up to this point, we’ve talked about using AI like an Iron Man suit: powerful, amplifying, and under your control. You give the commands, and the suit responds. But now the metaphor is shifting. What if, instead of a suit you pilot, you were gaining actual teammates—moldable, trainable, eager-to-please teammates who can learn how to work the way *you* want them to?

That’s what AI offers when you use it well. You’re not just piloting a tool. You’re cloning yourself.

## Virtual Recruits: Eager, Pliable, and Complaint-Free

These virtual teammates don’t come with egos or habits of their own. They don’t argue. They don’t forget your style preferences. They want to be shaped. They *want* to follow the playbook you hand them.

If you think of AI as cheap labor that scales endlessly, you might miss the real opportunity: **not just more hands, but more *versions of you*.** Versions that are happy to be mentored, reviewed, and corrected. That improve over time as your specifications become more precise. And that don’t push back when you ask them to change.

## Mentoring Is Specifying Is Training

This is why working with an LLM matters.

When you shape a clone using clear, specific artifacts—examples, templates, tone guides, annotated drafts—you’re not just asking for help. You’re mentoring. You’re handing down judgment.

Every prompt becomes a training moment. Every correction becomes a code update. Your specs *are* the way you scale your standards. That’s what makes them powerful—not just as instructions, but as **systems of thought**.

You can’t learn an LLM’s strengths by skimming a capabilities list. You have to experience them. Prompt by prompt, across different parts of a real project, you’ll start to absorb what it’s genuinely good at—what kinds of thinking it handles well, and where it needs structure or oversight.

That growing familiarity pays off. It’s how you build judgment into your clones. It’s how you guide their behavior without micromanaging every line. It’s how you clone not just your outputs, but your **standards**.

## Now Scale It: What a Pro Team Looks Like

Imagine you had a massive department. Unlimited resources. Your job is to produce next-level product documentation that sets the bar for clarity and quality. How would you run it?

You wouldn’t hand off the entire document to one person. You’d create stages. Specialists. Reviews.

Let’s say your process looks like this:

1. **Initial Content Drafting**: A researcher or subject matter expert puts together the raw material.
2. **Structural Editing**: A content strategist reshapes it for flow, clarity, and coherence.
3. **Tone and Voice Pass**: A copy editor adjusts for brand voice, tone, and polish.
4. **Final Review and QA**: A lead reviewer checks for alignment to goals, technical accuracy, and final approval.

Each step is a hat. Each hat has a different priority. And each requires different instincts.

That’s the real power of clones.

You don’t need to be every expert at once. You can train multiple AIs—or a single one in multiple modes—to wear different hats. Each with its own version of the spec.

And just like in *Multiplicity*, you get slightly different versions of yourself. But unlike the movie, you can shape each one precisely. Each clone gets its own handbook. Each step gets its own tuning.

To take this system-wide, though, we need to expand the frame. Not just how to train your clones—but how to wire them into the way work actually moves.
