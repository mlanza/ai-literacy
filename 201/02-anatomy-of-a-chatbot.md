# Anatomy of a Chatbot

Now that you’ve heard from the applicant, let’s take a step back.

What exactly are you hiring?

ChatGPT may present itself as a single voice, but behind that voice is a system made up of several key parts — each one essential to how the tool works and what it can do. Think of it like an advanced suit of armor: powerful on its own, but only as effective as the person operating it. At the core are three components:

* **Brain** – This is the large language model, or LLM. It’s the engine that generates text, responds to questions, and analyzes patterns in language. It can simulate understanding — fast, fluent, and surprisingly capable. But it doesn’t know your goals, your team, or the specifics of your job unless you tell it.
* **Memory** – This is what lets the app “hold onto” information across a conversation. It’s not the model itself, but the surrounding scaffolding: the prompt, the transcript, the past turns — all stitched together to give the brain the context it needs. It’s temporary, but crucial.
* **Tools** – These are the optional extensions: search, code execution, file analysis, and more. They let the app reach beyond what the model already knows. But again — they only act when you choose to activate them.

These parts don’t operate independently. They rely on each other — and on you. The model can write, but only if it’s given the right context. Memory can provide that context, but only if it’s been properly framed. Tools can extend the app’s reach, but only if the right one is chosen, at the right moment.

That’s why your role matters.

Working with ChatGPT isn’t about pressing a button and getting answers. It’s about learning how to guide it — when to narrow the focus, when to add structure, when to reset the memory, or draw in a tool. These decisions shape the outcome.

In that sense, using the suit is a skill. And like any skill, it exists on a spectrum. The more you understand what the parts do — and how they work together — the more precise, useful, and aligned your results will be.

While this chapter focuses on ChatGPT, this model of thinking — Brain, Memory, Tools — applies broadly. Nearly every AI assistant, copilot, or chat integration relies on the same foundational setup, even if the labels are different. Once you understand how to pilot one, you’ve started learning how to work with them all.

Next, we’ll take a closer look at each piece — starting with the brain.
