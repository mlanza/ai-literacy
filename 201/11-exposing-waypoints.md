# Exposing Waypoints — The Path to Meaningful Collaboration

### The Shortcut Temptation

It’s easy to imagine AI as a magical assistant that can create complete deliverables from just a few instructions. Say you wanted to write a book about your area of expertise—for example, *how to write effective product documentation*. Let’s say your team just built a custom ticketing solution for your organization’s IT helpdesk. You want to create a guide that helps new team members understand how it works, why certain design decisions were made, and how to use it effectively across roles.

You wouldn’t just bark an order to AI to “write a book about our ticketing system” and provide a few paragraphs about what it should cover. That’s too simplistic. While AI might give you a book that technically fits your request, it would likely be messy and inconsistent—even if you told it to organize the material. It can only do so much. It lacks human judgment, taste, and aesthetic. You might get something passable, but not publishable. Not the kind of reference you’d actually want new hires to read.

That’s what people miss. When they scoff at AI’s abilities, it’s often because they imagine a shortcut scenario—one that skips all the effort real-world deliverables require.

### What People Miss

What people often miss when they dismiss AI-generated work is that they picture the *leap* — not the *path*. They imagine someone shouting “make a deliverable!” and the AI spitting something out. But real work doesn’t work like that. Every polished outcome is the product of countless steps, insights, and revisions—connections that only appear when the process is stretched and made visible.

### Waypoints: The Real Path

Let’s introduce the missing ingredient: **waypoints**.

Waypoints are the intermediate outputs that emerge when you stop hiding the process. They’re not the final product, but they’re not filler either. They’re the working drafts, outlines, critiques, and tone guides that give shape to the journey from idea to result. They are **artifacts** — real, inspectable pieces of work that make your thinking visible.

And here’s the important distinction: these artifacts come in two broad forms.

#### **Work Artifacts**

These are tied directly to the **project at hand** — the specific content you're trying to produce. A rejected analogy. A first-pass outline. A cleaned-up stakeholder summary. They’re useful within the current context, but not necessarily beyond it.

#### **Workflow Artifacts**

These emerge from the **process you used** to produce the work. They’re the reusable parts: the checklist you made after coaching the AI, the tone guide you wrote for future drafts, the SOP you updated after seeing what was missing. These are meta-level artifacts—reflections of how you work, not just what you’re working on.

You might call them **product artifacts** and **process artifacts**, but we’ll use the terms **work artifacts** and **workflow artifacts** to keep the emphasis on action and repeatability.

This is why *waypoints matter*. Waypoints are the artifacts of both kinds—born not from shortcuts, but from exposure. They exist because the process was made real, and each stage of that process left something behind.

### Why Waypoints Appear

Imagine the process of creating a deliverable as a kind of petri net: a bead moves from one cup to the next, following defined steps. The more distinct stages you introduce—cups, in this metaphor—the more paths emerge between them. More checkpoints. More opportunities for insight.

When you stretch the process—when you stop trying to leap from input to output in a single bound—you force the **connections** into being. And those connections leave **byproducts**. Waypoints appear because the process is no longer compressed; it’s reified. Each step creates an opening for something new to form—a list, a rule, a reusable insight.

This is how skepticism turns to clarity. People doubt AI because they only see the leap. But once they see the steps—the waypoints, the artifacts, the evolving judgment—they understand where AI fits in. They start to see it not as a shortcut, but as a capable partner, walking alongside them.

### Don’t Skip the Byproducts

Here’s the irony: the real value of AI emerges *when you make it do the intermediate work*. When you say, “Help me plan the process,” and then walk it step-by-step through that plan. When you react to each draft, course-correct, revise, and refine.

That’s collaboration. You bring your taste and discernment. The model brings speed, fluency, and structure. You work together—and you get something stronger than either of you could produce alone.

And along the way, you accumulate artifacts:

* Some are **work artifacts**: project-specific and contextual.
* Others are **workflow artifacts**: generalizable, meta-level insights about how you want the work done.

Both matter. But only one set needs to be carried forward. That’s why it’s worth knowing the difference.

### Optimize for Reuse

Earlier, we talked about the power of structure—not just to impose order, but to let you manipulate entire *labeled boxes* of thinking. The same applies here.

As you create byproducts—waypoints—in your process, it’s worth asking: **which ones are worth saving**?

#### Examples of Work Artifacts:

* A tone option that hit the mark
* A cleaned-up diagram for one stakeholder group
* A feature list adapted for a specific team

These may be useful within the project, but often have limited shelf life. They serve immediate needs, shaped by the expectations of your stakeholders and the specificity of the deliverable.

But the real leverage comes from a different kind of artifact—the ones that transcend the project.

#### Examples of Workflow Artifacts:

* A reusable prompt for calibrating tone
* A checklist for writing with second-person voice
* A decision log format you can drop into future projects

These are **meta-byproducts**: insights about how you work, not just what you made. They’re reusable not because they’re flashy, but because they encode *judgment*. That’s what turns experience into scale.

So here’s the shift: **don’t just look for reuse in the obvious outputs.** Look in the fallout. In the notes you left behind. In the moments where you coached the model, sharpened a list, or rephrased a prompt to land better.

Reuse isn’t about keeping everything. It’s about **learning to sift**—to spot the patterns, fragments, and formats that will serve you again later. That’s how you improve every time you repeat a kind of project. Not just by doing the same thing faster, but by harvesting what you’ve learned—and carrying it forward.

That’s the value proposition: not just faster work, but smarter systems.

Your stakeholders may only want the final deliverable. But your job—the one that pays long-term dividends—is to quietly gather the **infrastructure** behind the scenes. That’s what builds your library. That’s how you scale your standards. And that’s how you grow into someone who gets better with every loop, because **you’re watching for what’s worth keeping**.

### This Is Not a Shortcut—It’s Training in Disguise

When you work with AI this way—directly, repeatedly, with feedback at every step—you’re not cutting corners. You’re doing the real work: scrutinizing, refining, and making judgment calls. The only difference is that you’re no longer doing it alone.

In fact, what you’re really doing is **training your collaborator**.

Each time you push back on phrasing, explain why one outline is clearer than another, or mark a tone as off-brand, you’re shaping the model’s next move. It may not learn across sessions, but *within* a session, it responds and adapts to the standards you set. You’re treating it the same way you would treat a newly onboarded teammate: giving it early tasks, reviewing its output, offering correction, and gradually entrusting it with more responsibility.

This isn’t a shortcut—it’s mentorship. And mentorship leaves behind evidence: notes, checklists, examples. Those are your workflow artifacts. That’s the **real value**.

### Collaboration Means Seeing the Work

When you expose the process—when you stop skipping ahead and instead ask the model to write the outline, reflect on structure, test alternative phrasings, or summarize feedback—you make the invisible visible.

That’s how waypoints are born. You’re no longer hiding the complexity of your thinking. You’re shaping it into a form you can act on. And that form leaves behind both:

* **Work artifacts**, tied to the specific deliverable.
* **Workflow artifacts**, tied to how the work was done.

Now both collaborators can do their best work:

* The AI gets to operate in its zone of strength: fast iteration, structured output, semantic synthesis.
* You get to apply your strengths: taste, context, judgment, nuance.

The human still has the final say. But by walking the path—and capturing what falls out of that walk—you get a product that’s truly worthy of your standards.

And maybe, just maybe, you end up with more than a finished deliverable. You end up with a **stronger process**—and the artifacts to prove it.
