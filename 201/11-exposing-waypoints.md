## Exposing Waypoints — The Path to Meaningful Collaboration

### The Shortcut Temptation

It’s easy to imagine AI as a magical assistant that can create complete deliverables from just a few instructions. Say you wanted to write a book about your area of expertise—for example, *how to write effective product documentation*. Let’s say your team just built a custom ticketing solution for your organization’s IT helpdesk. You want to create a guide that helps new team members understand how it works, why certain design decisions were made, and how to use it effectively across roles.

You wouldn’t just bark an order to AI to “write a book about our ticketing system” and provide a few paragraphs about what it should cover. That’s too simplistic. While AI might give you a book that technically fits your request, it would likely be messy and inconsistent—even if you told it to organize the material. It can only do so much. It lacks human judgment, taste, and aesthetic. You might get something passable, but not publishable. Not the kind of reference you’d actually want new hires to read.

That’s what people miss. When they scoff at AI’s abilities, it’s often because they imagine a shortcut scenario—one that skips all the effort real-world deliverables require.

### What People Miss

What people often miss when they scoff at AI-generated work is that they imagine only the leap—not the journey. They picture someone barking, “Make a deliverable!” and AI obliging, poorly. But real work doesn’t work like that. Every polished outcome is the product of countless steps, insights, and revisions—waypoints on the path to a final result.

AI *can* take shortcuts, but shortcuts show. The output often lands somewhere around a C-grade. Not terrible—but not special. And in today’s world of content saturation, why add another mediocre piece to the pile?

### Waypoints: The Real Path

Let’s introduce the missing ingredient: **waypoints**.

Waypoints are the intermediate steps you’d naturally pass through when doing thoughtful, structured work. They’re the outlines, drafts, brainstorms, critiques, summaries, and planning documents you’d build along the way. They are the **materialized thinking** that turns a vague idea into a crafted product.

If you skip these steps—if you ask AI to go from zero to final product in one move—you’re skipping the very work that gives creative output its quality.

### Don’t Skip the Byproducts

Here’s the irony: the real value of AI emerges *when you make it do the intermediate work*. When you say, “Help me plan the process,” and then walk it step-by-step through that plan. When you react to each draft, course-correct, revise, and refine.

That’s collaboration. You bring your taste and discernment. The model brings speed, fluency, and structure. You work together—and you get something stronger than either of you could produce alone.

Waypoints are more than just tasks. They are **artifacts**—pieces of work that carry meaning, context, and decision history. Some are ephemeral (chat turns that disappear after the session ends). Others should be saved and shaped into reusable assets.

### Optimize for Reuse

Earlier, we talked about the power of structure—not just to impose order, but to let you manipulate entire *labeled boxes* of thinking. Waypoints should follow the same principle. As you create byproducts in your process—outlines, tone guides, drafts, decision logs—don’t just let them pile up. Think about how to *structure them for longevity*.

Some of these byproducts will only matter for this specific project. But others will be worth saving, naming, and storing—not for nostalgia, but for reuse. This is the real value of working in labeled sections and named buckets: you’re not just organizing ideas, you’re **deliberately managing the knowledge you’re building**.

Deciding what goes into each box matters—because it **modularizes** your work. You’re turning messy ideas into distinct, portable components. Each module is self-contained and labeled, which means later you can choose which pieces to bring forward into new projects. That’s how reuse happens: not by saving everything, but by curating and packaging what’s worth keeping.

You might group waypoints differently depending on the task—by topic, by audience, by format, by phase of work. But whatever method you use, **reusability is the driver**. You’re not organizing for its own sake—you’re doing it so you can find, adapt, and deploy the most valuable parts of your thinking again later.

Examples:

* **Specific waypoints:** Useful only in the context of a single project
  (e.g., a rejected analogy, a draft user flow for this system)
* **Generic waypoints:** Useful across projects—the ones you want to carry forward and reach for later:

  * A repeatable framework for structuring a proposal
  * A reusable tone guide for plainspoken communication
  * A checklist for reviewing AI-generated content
  * A standard format for summarizing feedback from stakeholders

Each time you ask the model to create a list, label a pattern, or separate ideas into categories, you’re commanding thinking into *new piles*. That’s not just organization—that’s how you extract value. You’re building a toolkit you can bring into the next conversation, the next system, the next team.

### This Is Not a Shortcut—It’s Training in Disguise

When you work with AI this way—directly, repeatedly, with feedback at every step—you’re not cutting corners. You’re doing the real work: scrutinizing, refining, and making judgment calls. The only difference is that you’re no longer doing it alone.

In fact, what you’re really doing is **training your collaborator**.

Each time you push back on phrasing, explain why one outline is clearer than another, or mark a tone as off-brand, you’re shaping the model’s next move. It may not learn across sessions, but *within* a session, it responds and adapts to the standards you set. You’re treating it the same way you would treat a newly onboarded teammate: giving it early tasks, reviewing its output, offering correction, and gradually entrusting it with more responsibility.

This isn’t a shortcut—it’s mentorship. You’re helping the AI internalize what “good” looks like for *this* project, *this* audience, *this* goal. That’s not the easy path. But it is the one that leads to outcomes you can be proud of.

### Collaboration Means Seeing the Work

When you force these waypoints into existence—when you stop skipping ahead and instead ask the model to write the outline, reflect on structure, test alternative phrasings, or summarize feedback—you make the invisible visible.

Now both collaborators can do their best work:

* The AI gets to operate in its zone of strength: fast iteration, structured output, semantic synthesis.
* You get to apply your strengths: taste, context, judgment, nuance.

The human still has the final say. But by walking the path—and exposing the waypoints—you get a product that’s truly worthy of your standards.

And here’s what often happens next: **the skeptic becomes the convert**. Once you’ve seen the way AI can walk with you—not ahead of you, not instead of you—you start to understand the real value. It’s not about barking out an order and hoping for brilliance. It’s about thoughtfully guiding a process. Directing. Shaping. Teaching. Correcting. And doing all of that with a partner who never gets tired, never takes offense, and always aims to help.

What seemed like magic turns out to be something better: *craft*.

And what seemed like a shortcut turns out to be the beginning of a new way of working.
