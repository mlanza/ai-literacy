# Exposing Waypoints — The Path to Meaningful Collaboration

## No Shortcuts Here

People say it all the time:
*“Sure, AI can write a book—but would you want to read it?”*

They’re not wrong.

If you treat a book like a task—like something a model can generate from a single prompt—you’ll get something that reads like it.  Shortchanged in too many ways to count.

That’s what they scoff at.  They *know*, instinctively, it won’t work.  Not well anyway.

You can’t just tell a machine to write something complex and expect it to come back polished, coherent, and worth reading.

They’re right, of course.

The work can’t be skipped.

The real delusion isn’t trusting AI.

It’s thinking you can leap from idea to outcome without putting in the effort.

That’s what the shortcut misses.

A deliverable isn’t a one-step command. It’s a sequence. A structure. A series of revisions and refinements—none of which happen if you expect the model to leap straight to the finish.

But there’s another way.

Not “AI writes the book.”

*AI helps you write the book.*

That’s what you’ve been learning to do.

You’ve practiced rebooting when things get murky.

You’ve started naming ideas, bucketing decisions, boxing what’s worth keeping.

You’ve learned how to compress large inputs and scale signal.

Those are more than clever tricks.

They’re working methods. Repeatable. Reliable. Sharpened through use.

And something else starts to happen when you use them.

You stop thinking only about the outcome—and start noticing the steps.

The summaries. The outlines. The rejected versions. The tone notes.

Pieces of the process that aren’t just helpful in the moment.

They’re valuable on their own.

This chapter is about those pieces.

Not just artifacts, but **waypoints**—concrete markers of how good work gets made.

Not scraps. Not leftovers.

Evidence. Structure. Memory.

And the better you get at spotting them, the more power you have to reuse what works—and leave the noise behind.

## Waypoints: The Real Path

Waypoints are the intermediate outputs that emerge when you stop hiding the process. They’re not the final product, but they’re not filler either. They’re the working drafts, outlines, critiques, and tone guides that give shape to the journey from idea to result. They are **artifacts** — real, inspectable pieces of work that make your thinking visible.

It’s like when a teacher asks students to show their work—not because the answer alone is useless, but because the *process* reveals the reasoning, effort, and opportunities for feedback. That’s what waypoints are. They make thinking visible, teachable, and steerable.

They aren’t just clutter on the path. They’re proof that the path exists. Each one captures a moment where the work could be reviewed, refined, or redirected—by you or by the AI. They're the steps made explicit.

The distinction is these artifacts come in two broad forms.

### Product Artifacts

These are tied directly to the project at hand—the specific content you're trying to produce. A rejected analogy. A first-pass outline. A cleaned-up stakeholder summary. They’re useful within the current context, but not necessarily beyond it.

### Process Artifacts

These emerge from the process you used to produce the work. They’re the reusable parts: the checklist you made after coaching the AI, the tone guide you wrote for future drafts, the SOP you updated after seeing what was missing. These are meta-level artifacts—reflections of how you work, not just what you’re working on.

You might also call them **work artifacts** and **workflow artifacts**.  The former leans specific, the latter generic.

This is why waypoints matter. Waypoints are artifacts of both kinds—born not from shortcuts, but from exposure. They exist because the process was made real, and each stage of that process left something behind.

When we first discussed **context engineering** we lacked the framing to explain it in its full glory.  It’s not just barking the right command to get the right outcome. It’s also carrying memory forward—both the memory of *what* was made and *how* it was made.

One kind of memory is the product: the deliverable, the draft, the thing you're trying to build. The other kind is the process: the tone guides, the prompts that worked, the refinements that mattered. Both are vital. Together, the perfect payload includes not only a prompt, but data in the form of product and process artifacts.

Waypoints make that possible. They’re not just detours. They’re deposits of memory. They’re how you build smarter prompts, sharper expectations, and better tools for your next round.

## Why Waypoints Appear

Imagine the process of creating a deliverable as a kind of petri net: a bead moves from one cup to the next, following defined steps. The more distinct stages you introduce—cups, in this metaphor—the more paths emerge between them. More checkpoints. More opportunities for insight.

When you stretch the process—when you stop trying to leap from input to output in a single bound—you force the **connections** into being. And those connections leave **byproducts**. Waypoints appear because the process is no longer compressed; it’s reified. Each step creates an opening for something new to form—a list, a rule, a reusable insight.

This is how skepticism turns to clarity. People doubt AI because they only see the leap. But once they see the steps—the waypoints, the artifacts, the evolving judgment—they understand where AI fits in. They start to see it not as a shortcut, but as a capable partner, walking alongside them.

### Collaboration Means Seeing the Work

This is what meaningful collaboration looks like.

When you stop skipping ahead and instead ask the model to write the outline, reflect on structure, test alternative phrasings, or summarize feedback, you bring the process into view. You’re no longer hiding your own thinking—you’re shaping it in real time, with help. And that shared visibility is what makes the results better.

The AI gets to operate in its zone of strength: fast iteration, structured output, semantic synthesis. You get to apply your strengths: taste, context, judgment, nuance.

You don’t lose control by letting the model participate in the process. You gain leverage—because both of you can now see the work unfold, step by step.

### Don’t Skip the Byproducts

That’s the irony. The real value of AI emerges *when you make it do the intermediate work*. When you say, “Help me plan the process,” and then walk it step-by-step through that plan. When you react to each draft, course-correct, revise, and refine.

That’s where the artifacts come from.

They’re not just scraps along the way. They’re the evidence of thinking. They’re what let you spot errors early, capture reusable pieces, and shape the final output to match your judgment.

You’re not outsourcing the work. You’re sharing it—and gaining visibility in return.

### **Surfacing the Facts**

Not all artifacts emerge naturally. Some have to be *surfaced*.

Think about filling out a form. The form doesn’t just gather info — it *makes* you articulate it. You can’t get the license until you write your name. You can’t get a quote until you specify what you’re buying. The form isn’t decoration. It’s a forcing function.

Same goes here.

Each time the model asks you a structured question — or you give it one to ask *you* — it’s a way of pulling unstated context into the open. You’re no longer just chatting. You’re loading memory, deliberately. And that matters, because until an idea is in the thread, the model can’t reason with it.

The only usable facts are the ones you’ve said out loud. Everything else is invisible ink.

So when you ask the model to prompt you through a stakeholder brief, or to generate a checklist of required constraints, or to gather goals before starting a draft — you’re shaping the future, not just tidying the present. You’re *materializing* your thinking in a format the AI can work with.

You’re building clarity on purpose. One prompt at a time.

### **Saving the Machine State**

Now zoom out.

What if you didn’t have to do that setup every time?

That’s what a **custom GPT** is — not a smarter model, just a **preloaded workspace**. A frozen configuration with instructions, tone, context, and reference material already in place. It’s not thinking differently. It’s just starting from a different place.

Think of it like a virtual machine.

You boot up a fresh instance, install some docs, tweak the environment, give it a name — then hit save. What you’ve captured is a **moment in time**: a known context, a fixed bias, a ready-to-work assistant.

Every time you launch it, you’re not starting from scratch. You’re resuming from that snapshot — like a VM waking up exactly where it left off.

System prompts are the same idea.  They're prompts you provide in your ChatGPT settings that become part of every conversation.  They live beneath the surface, shaping how the model responds before you say a word. They don’t hold memory, but they hold **influence**. A tone. A mindset. A subtle pressure on every future turn.

You can’t see them in the thread, but they’re always there — the quiet cousin of your visible waypoints.

So whether you’re structuring a one-off session or configuring a reusable GPT, the same principle applies: frontloaded thinking isn’t wasted. It’s scaffolding. And it stays with you.

You’re not just prompting. You’re staging an environment.

### Optimize for Reuse

The trick is to treat those moments—where you intervene, steer, or clarify—as more than one-off events. They’re often signals worth preserving.

You’ll only see them if you’re looking. But once you do, you can start boxing them up: the reusable prompt that calibrated the right tone, the checklist you surfaced while refining structure, the “note to self” that turned into a house rule for future projects.

In this particular run, maybe you realized you were constantly correcting for overly abstract intros—so you wrote a note about grounding content in user context. Maybe you came up with a better way to frame feedback for stakeholder summaries. Maybe the AI helped you generate a style checklist that will save you half an hour next time.

Those pieces aren’t just leftovers. They’re **fuel** for your next project—modular, portable specs that let your past effort compound over time.

That’s the shift. You’re no longer starting from scratch. You’re building a system.

### This Is Not a Shortcut—It’s Training in Disguise

When you work with AI this way—directly, repeatedly, with feedback at every step—you’re not cutting corners. You’re doing the real work: scrutinizing, refining, and making judgment calls. The only difference is that you’re no longer doing it alone.

In fact, what you’re really doing is **mentoring your collaborator**.

Each time you push back on phrasing, explain why one outline is clearer than another, or mark a tone as off-brand, you’re shaping the model’s next move. It may not learn across sessions, but *within* a session, it responds and adapts to the standards you set. You’re treating it the same way you would treat a newly onboarded teammate: giving it early tasks, reviewing its output, offering correction, and gradually entrusting it with more responsibility.

This isn’t just process visibility—it’s systems thinking. You’re creating feedback loops that don’t just improve the work, but *carry your judgment forward*.

### The Boon of Byproducts

So let’s be clear: the real win isn’t just that you produced useful artifacts along the way. The deeper value is that you gained **access** to them—because you stretched the process and made it visible.

Instead of hiding the mess, you walked through it. Instead of skipping to the end, you paused at the waypoints. And in doing so, you created space for meaningful collaboration.

The artifacts weren’t the goal. They were the *consequence* of involving yourself—of reacting, refining, and redirecting as the work evolved. The AI handled the structure and speed. You brought the discernment. And together, you didn’t just get it done—you got it *right*.

That’s why the final product feels worthy of your standards.

Because you *saw how it came to be*. You stayed in the loop. You caught drift early. You reinforced what worked. You treated the interaction not as a transaction, but as a working relationship.

And that’s the real shift.

You’re not just using AI to get things done faster. You’re treating it like a teammate—one that gets better the more you coach it. One that can take on real responsibility when you invest in guiding its steps. One that’s capable of helping you produce your best work, because you brought it into the process with intention.

This isn’t about shortcuts. It’s about standards, mentorship and, ultimately, collaboration—and that’s not feasible when you shortcircuit the process and all that actually entails.
