# Craft

> In the beginning[...] God saw that it was good.<br>
> [...]<br>
> And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. — Genesis 1:25, 31, ESV

That rhythm — create, observe, approve — always resonated with me.

There’s something primal about the moment when you look back at what you’ve made and just... know.

That it’s right. That it’s worthy. That it’s good.

I’ve always understood that feeling. Not in an abstract way. In a visceral one.

The deep satisfaction of not just getting something done, but getting it done well. That quiet inner nod — *yes, this is solid work* — has always meant more to me than praise or performance reviews.

Because for me, it was never just about crossing something off a list. It was about how the thing got done.

To be fair, I’m not like that with everything. Just with the work I really care about.

I care about the feel. The rhythm. The way the little pieces click together. That’s what I mean when I say “craft.”

Craft is caring how it comes off.

## It's Always Been About Craft

Much of what we’ve covered in this course has been about craft, whether or not we used that word.

When I said you shouldn’t treat a big task as a single leap... When I said you needed to stretch it out... To make the process visible... To let the seams show...

That was about craft. Because what we’re doing here isn’t just trying to get to done. We’re designing a way to get there that we can stand behind. A way that reflects the standards we want to be known for.

And that means thinking about the path.

## Craft is Choice

Let’s revisit that metaphor: a bead moving through cups — a process broken into stages.

Each cup exists because it represents something someone cares about.

A value. A standard. A checkpoint.

And someone watches that cup. When the bead arrives, they act.

But which cups? In what order? Even just six of them opens up a million permutations. And that’s the point.

Take the game *Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.* Pick any actor — doesn’t matter who. You can trace a path to Bacon through other actors they’ve worked with. But those paths? They vary wildly.

Same with ideas.

You’ll sometimes hear someone say, “Hey, I thought of that!” when they see a product succeed. As if having the idea deserves the credit. But ideas aren’t endpoints. They’re starting points.

What matters is how the idea moved. Which cups it passed through. Who was watching each one. What decisions they made.

The path is everything.

## Complexity Isn't Craft

Not every checkpoint improves the outcome. Eventually, they slow it down. And if you treat every concern as a new priority, you wind up with no priorities.

That’s the paradox of overengineering.

Too many cups, and quality degrades. Because attention is spread thin. Because nobody knows what really matters anymore.

And sometimes, adding more people — more eyes, more hands — doesn’t clarify things. It blurs them.

It’s like a mission statement that tries to say everything. It winds up standing for nothing.

That’s often why I push back — not out of stubbornness, but out of care.  Resisting a request isn’t always about time or effort. Sometimes it’s about protecting the shape of the thing.

Craft is choosing your cups — and choosing what not to include. And then owning how each one shapes what comes out.

## Craft Means Getting Your Hands Dirty

Ideas aren’t rare. Implementation is.

You’ve probably seen this yourself: A great idea, poorly executed, is forgotten. But an average idea, crafted with care, can resonate for years.

That’s the asymmetry.

Execution has leverage. And the real weight is in the process — the judgment calls, the refinements, the paths you *didn’t* take.

## Where Craft Hides

A lot of people never feel this, because they’re stationed at a single cup.

Their view is narrow. They don’t see the whole path. They don’t know what came before or what comes after.

But with AI? Your ability to scale, to own more is starting to change.  Because now, if you’re inclined to, you can move with the bead. Monitor the virtual. Give it feedback, refine its playbook.

You can participate in every step. Watch the whole process unfold. And you can leave your fingerprints at every cup.  That’s what process-level work with AI enables.

## Moving Beyond The Prompt

This doesn’t happen with one-off prompts.

But if you’ve ever used ChatGPT to write something substantial —

Something that took days, not minutes —

Then you know the feeling. You see the iterations. You make the calls. You wear the hats.

You don’t just issue commands — you curate. You direct. That's the essence of what craft is.

## Craft is in the Caring

Even something as deceptively simple as writing a blog post shows it.

You give it a starter prompt. It comes back with a take.

You respond. You ask for alternatives. You tweak tone. You nudge structure.

You don’t stop until it reads right. You’re involved. You’re shaping. You’re making choices. And that’s the difference.

Craft is in the caring.

## The Vehicle Doesn't Define the Journey

So when people dismiss AI-generated content, as if craft has been lost — I think they’re missing the point.

The question isn’t “Was AI used?” The question is “Did someone care enough to shape the work?”

Because AI doesn’t erase craft. It gives us more ways to express it.

Same way the train, the car, the airplane didn’t erase travel — they expanded its reach. They made possible what was once impractical.

The journey still mattered. The destination still mattered. But now, more people could go.

You can still direct, revise, refine. You can still wear every hat — editor, critic, coach.

If you're really invested in getting to “it is good”, you’ll put in the effort to get there.

## Nothing Automatic About It

Craft doesn’t scale infinitely.

It doesn’t come from a one-line command. And it never has.

What you’re seeing — if you’re really looking — is the residue of effort. The judgment calls. The back-and-forths. The forks that were taken — and the ones that weren’t.

It’s the product of dozens of checks. Then redirections. Then more checks. Too many to count, honestly.

Not because the work was difficult. But because someone actually cared how it came out.

That’s what’s visible in the final result — if you care about it. Evidence of presence. Ownership. Reentry.

And whether AI played a role or not?

That’s not the headline. That’s just the vehicle. The shape of the work — its tone, integrity, structure — those are human fingerprints.

So no, it didn’t “just come out like that.” It was made. And if it’s worth something, it’s because somebody made it matter.
