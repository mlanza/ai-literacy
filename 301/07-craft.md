# Craft

> In the beginning[...] God saw that it was good.<br>
> [...]<br>
> And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. — Genesis 1:25, 31, ESV

That rhythm — create, observe, approve — always resonated with me.

There’s something primal about the moment when you look back at what you’ve made and just... know. That it’s right. That it’s worthy. That it’s good.

I’ve always understood that feeling. Not in an abstract way. In a visceral one.

The deep satisfaction of not just getting something done, but getting it done well.

That quiet inner nod — *yes, this is solid work* — has always meant more to me than praise or performance reviews.

Because for me, it was never just about crossing something off a list. It was about how the thing got done.

To be fair, I’m not like that with everything. Just the work I really care about.  The details matter. The way everything clicks together.

That’s what I mean when I say “craft.”  Craft is caring how it comes off.

## It's Always Been About Craft

Much of what we’ve covered in this course has been about craft, whether or not we used that word.

When I said you shouldn’t treat a big task as a single leap... When I said you needed to stretch it out... To make the process visible... To let the seams show...

That was about craft. Because what we’re doing here isn’t just trying to get to done. We’re designing a way to get there that we can stand behind. A way that reflects the standards we want to be known for.

And that means thinking about the path.

## Craft is Choosing Your Cups...

Let’s revisit that metaphor: a bead moving through cups — a process broken into stages.

Each cup exists because it represents something someone cares about.

A value. A standard. A checkpoint.

And someone watches that cup. When the bead arrives, they act.

But which cups? In what order? Even just six of them opens up a million permutations. And that’s the point.

Take the game *Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.* Pick any actor — doesn’t matter who. You can trace a path to Bacon through other actors they’ve worked with. But those paths? Countless.

Same with ideas.

You’ll sometimes hear someone say, “Hey, I thought of that!” when they see a product succeed. As if having the idea deserves the credit. But ideas aren’t endpoints. They’re starting points.

What matters is how the idea moved. Which cups it passed through. Who was watching each one. What decisions they made.

The path is everything.

## ...But Not Too Many

Not every checkpoint improves the outcome. Eventually, they slow it down. And if you treat every concern as a new priority, you wind up with no priorities.

That’s the paradox of overengineering.

Too many cups, and quality degrades. Because attention is spread thin. Because nobody knows what really matters anymore.

And sometimes, adding more people — more eyes, more hands — doesn’t clarify things. It blurs them.

It’s like a mission statement that tries to say everything. It winds up standing for nothing.

That’s often why I push back — not out of stubbornness, but out of care.  Resisting a request isn’t always about time or effort. Sometimes it’s about preserving the integrity of the product.

Craft is choosing your cups — and choosing what not to include. And then owning how each one shapes what comes out.

## Craft Is More Nuture Than Seed

Ideas aren’t rare. Implementation is.

Execution has leverage. And the real weight is in the process — the judgment calls, the refinements, the paths you *didn’t* take.

And the ones you did — the ones that mattered — they weren’t always planned from the start. They emerged at the cups.

Each cup held a moment where hands could shape the bead. A small fork. A chance to steer. Not in grand gestures, but in tweaks — a nudge in tone, a question reframed, a second pass that noticed what the first one missed.

And each of those choices — small as they seemed — folded in a new possibility. The shape of the final thing was never fixed. It was bent, bit by bit, by attention.

Different cups, different stewards, and the same idea might’ve turned out entirely different.  *Withered*.

That’s the part people overlook. They chase the spark, not the structure. They admire what came out, without seeing what went in.

But when something lands — when it really lands — it isn’t because the idea was perfect.

It’s because everything before it did its part.

The outcome is what it is *because of the path it traveled* — not for the seed it started from, but for the soil it moved through. Rich with judgment. Watered with care.

## Where Craft Hides

A lot of people never feel this, because they’re stationed at a single cup.

Their view is narrow. They don’t see the whole path. They don’t know what came before or what comes after.

But with AI? Your ability to scale, to own more is starting to change.  Because now, if you’re inclined to, you can move with the bead. Monitor the virtual. Give it feedback, refine its playbook.

You can participate in every step. Watch the whole process unfold. And you can leave your fingerprints at every cup.  That’s what process-level work with AI enables.

## Moving Beyond the Prompt

This doesn’t happen with one-off prompts.

But if you’ve ever used ChatGPT to write something substantial —

Something that took days, not minutes —

Then you know the feeling. You see the iterations. You make the calls. You wear the hats.

You don’t just issue commands — you curate. You direct. That's the essence of what craft is.

## Craft is in the Caring

Even something as deceptively simple as writing a blog post shows it.

You give it a starter prompt. It comes back with a take.

You respond. You ask for alternatives. You tweak tone. You nudge structure.

You don’t stop until it reads right. You’re involved. You’re shaping. You’re making choices. And that’s the difference.

Craft is in the caring.

## 🚗 The Vehicle Doesn’t Define the Journey

So when people dismiss AI-generated content — as if craft has been lost — I think they’re missing the point. *It’s not necessarily a shortcut.*

The question isn’t

> “Was AI used?”

AI doesn’t erase craft. It just gives us more ways to reach the destination.

Same way the train, the car, the airplane didn’t erase travel — they expanded its reach. They made possible what was once impractical. People still traveled. They just did it differently.

Why get hung up on whether AI was involved? It’s not the headline. It’s the vehicle.

You’re in London. £20,000 on the line. Eighty days to circumnavigate the globe. Any route, any mode of travel.

*Why would you refuse the plane?*

## 🎯 Nothing Automatic About It

If you’re serious about getting to *“it is good,”* you’ll do what it takes to get there. And that makes the better question:

> “How much care was put into shaping the work?”

You were never going to get great from a one-liner.

You still direct. Revise. Refine. You still wear every hat — editor, critic, coach.

And if the system is built for collaboration — if it shows its turns, if it lets you walk with the bead — then you can be there at every stage. You can weigh the options. You can step in, correct course, leave your fingerprints in every cup.

But even when you’re not in the loop — even when the system runs without you — there’s still a role to play.

You can *review what it did*.

You can treat the output not just as an answer, but as a clue — a signal about how the system thinks, what it assumes, what it missed. And from that, you can tune the playbook. You can improve the reference material, tweak the various process artifacts. You can rewrite the prompt. You can spot bad habits, clarify the standard, reshape what gets handed to the model next time.

You start to manage the system the way a good manager develops people.

You don’t just respond to errors — you reinforce expectations. You don’t fix the work — you improve the working. You shape judgment, not just behavior. And over time, that becomes the job.

Not the doer. The shaper.

Not the engine. The calibration.

Still present. Still caring. Still accountable for what comes out — but now from a higher vantage. AI stations people above the work, not away from it. They must still mentor the workers, see the work is done well.  Should it matter they're virtuals?

And that’s what shows up in the final result — if you care about it. Evidence of presence. Ownership. Reentry.

So no, it doesn’t “just come out like that.” It’s made. Sometimes by standing beside it, shaping every move. Sometimes by stepping back, tuning the system that shapes it. Either way, it carries the mark of someone who cares about the details.

AI can assist. But craft is still a choice.  And it shows, when you mean it to.
