# Reifying Process

## 🧭 Conceiving a Process

You’ve seen what it looks like to work step by step, running a process with ChatGPT as your partner. Now it’s time to flip the lens.

This chapter kicks off a new tier — not just working *in* a process, but working *on* one.

We’re going to anchor the discussion with a specific scenario. Not because we’re choosing it, but because real examples make abstract thinking easier. It helps us reason more clearly about structure, handoffs, and system design when we have something tangible in front of us.

To stay grounded, we’re going to start with a scenario that’s personal, practical, and rich with moving parts.

### 🌍 Plan an International Trip

You’ll be coordinating flights, hotels, documents, preferences, constraints — and maybe other travelers too. The scope is clear, the outcome matters, and it’s repeatable. Which makes it the perfect proving ground.

Why this?

* **It’s personal** — Everyone brings preferences, constraints, and goals.
* **It’s practical** — There’s real research, coordination, and decision-making involved.
* **It’s repeatable** — You might do it again, and your system will evolve with each try.

The point is to work through something real — with inputs, steps, handoffs, and deliverables.

The goal here isn’t a perfect system. It’s **visible structure**. You’ll define waypoints. Track outputs. Spot friction. And in doing so, start to see what parts of the process are ripe for automation — and what still needs human judgment.

We’re not diving into full orchestration yet. In fact, we're not even going to fully build it out. But we are going to look at what that would entail.  Because unless run a process through, iterate on it a few times, your understanding will be shallow. Thinking through a process, and using it more than once is how you get a sense of what's really involved.

I want you to picture it. Not the trip itself, but the process. The system you’d build if you had to do this well — not once, but over and over.

Imagine writing it up like an SOP. You’re still in the driver’s seat. You’d do most of what you already do when planning a trip, but now you’ve got a chatbot riding shotgun. You can pull it in at any point — for drafting, searching, rewording, comparing — whatever makes the job easier. The goal here isn’t automation. Not yet. The goal is **awareness**. Capturing just enough of the structure and decisions that, next time through, you’d be better off. More prepared. Less scattered.

This is how a process becomes real.

You reify it — not with code, but with artifacts.

Now stretch a little further. What if you wanted to flip the balance? Sit back, let the chatbot do most of the heavy lifting? That’s a different kind of process. One where you still shape the goals, steer the decisions, but more of the work flows through AI.

That’s the spectrum.

Lean left — human-led, chatbot-assisted.

Lean right — AI-led, human-guided.

It’s still a partnership. The difference is who's doing the bulk of the work. And unlike a human partner, the machine never tires. That’s the promise — and the problem. Because making that shift isn’t trivial. Historically, it’s been the domain of developers. Not just individuals, but teams. The terrain is technical, the tooling immature, the burden high.

So we’re not going there. Not fully.

But we are going to peek over the edge.

Let’s take a few steps and see what it would really take.

## 🎯 Start with the End in Mind

Before you systemize a process, you need to understand what success actually looks like. That means starting not with steps, but with **artifacts** — the final outputs you want in hand once the process is complete.

In the case of planning an international trip, those artifacts are easy to imagine. You’ll want:

1. **Trip Brief**
   A short summary of the plan — where you're going, when, and why. Includes key constraints: budget, travel pace, personal needs.

2. **Final Itinerary**
   A day-by-day outline with times, locations, activities, confirmation codes, transit details, and backup options.

3. **Booking Tracker**
   A running list of all bookings: flights, hotels, trains, activities. Tracks what’s done and what’s pending.

4. **Travel Document Packet**
   A single file or folder with passport copies, visa info (if needed), emergency contacts, and lodging details.

5. **Pre-Trip Checklist**
   A to-do list covering document checks, insurance, phone prep, banking, and packing.

6. **Trip Review Notes**
   A short write-up of what worked and what you’d change.

7. **Reusable Templates or Prompts** 🤖
   Prompts, checklists, or patterns that worked well enough to save.

8. **Booking Windows Guide** 🤖
   Reference sheet that outlines when to book flights, trains, lodging, and activities for optimal pricing and availability.

9. **Readiness Criteria** 🤖
   A repeatable checklist to confirm logistical, personal, and administrative preparedness before departure.

Some artifacts — like personal preferences or logistics — are now treated as structured fields within larger artifacts (e.g. Trip Brief, Final Itinerary). This makes the SOP more compact, while keeping process clarity intact.

Artifacts marked with 🤖 are **process artifacts**: reusable elements that describe *how* the work is done, not just what was done.

## Zoomed Out, It’s a Machine

Hang on.

We just asked a couple of basic questions — what are the right outputs, and what’s a reasonable way to get them? That’s it. But even that tiny step cracked open something big. A full-blown system peeked out.

It’s a lot to take in.

We started with a single outcome in mind: plan an international trip. A pretty common scenario. But as we walked through what that entails — not just the destination, but all the research, the decisions, the bookings, the readiness checks — the list of artifacts ballooned. Not theoretically. Tangibly. PDFs, checklists, trackers, summaries. Some are product-specific, some reusable process assets, all real outputs that pile up fast.

That’s the point.

It’s not just complexity for complexity’s sake — it’s exposure. By stretching the process out, by making every phase explicit, we’re forcing the structure into view. And suddenly, you can see how many moving parts there are. How each step leaves something behind. How earlier outputs feed later decisions. How this isn’t a task. It’s a *system in waiting*.

The sheer scale is meant to overwhelm. Because that’s what most systems look like when you fully expose them.

And the truth is, we don’t normally do this. Not at this level. Not outside of formal organizations. Not without tooling.

Why?

Because you’re still holding the wrench.

## Manual Labor: The Hidden Cost of “Good Enough”

Most people plan trips with a notepad and a browser tab. Maybe a travel app. Maybe a calendar. They do it all manually because they’re carrying the memory in their head. No SOP. No versioning. No intermediate files. Just thoughts and clicks.

You see, humans are incredible at absorbing friction — especially when the alternative feels even worse. Hiring a travel agent feels expensive. Managing 12 artifacts and a planning SOP feels cumbersome. So we tolerate the mess, live in the tabs, scribble in the margins, and brute-force our way to a plan.

You do all the orchestration. You do all the remembering. Because there isn’t a system doing it for you.

That’s the limiting factor — not intelligence, but *infrastructure*.

Today’s tools still leave you turning the wrench manually. They don’t carry memory forward well. They don’t hold state across steps. They don’t trigger one another. Which means that as soon as you expose a process this large, it collapses under its own weight. Not because the work is impossible, but because the logistics are.

## LLMs Change the Math

That’s what’s shifting. Not because we’re suddenly building virtual travel agents — we’re not — but because we now have a machine that can *read*, *reason*, and *act* with words. That changes how we think about tasks like this.

The reason we’re not yet handing this over to bots is because **we haven’t built the scaffolding**. We haven’t delegated the steps. We haven’t turned the waypoints into interfaces. We’re still building the bridges.

But you can feel what’s coming.

We’re starting to see processes as systems. And when you expose a system — fully, artifact by artifact — you also expose the opportunity. You start to imagine virtual teammates seated at each step. Not to create some monolithic all-knowing bot, but to split the work: one agent for shortlisting destinations, one for scanning visa requirements, one for checking flight prices, one for updating the itinerary file. That’s not science fiction. That’s orchestration waiting for infrastructure.

And no, we’re not building that here.

But we *are* going to use this process to think clearly about how it *could* be built.

## Why Hasn’t This Worked Yet?

If you’ve ever tried to get a chatbot to plan a trip — or anything with this many moving parts — you already know the dance.

You bring it a prompt. It offers a list. You nudge it forward. It forgets something. You bring context again. It tries to help. You do most of the work.

It’s not that the model isn’t capable of doing the work. It is. But it’s a brain in a jar — helpful, responsive, even insightful at times. What it lacks is agency.

So you’re still cranking the wrench.

You’re the one figuring out what to bring into view, what to hand it next, how to stitch it all together. Sometimes that works. But often, it’s more overhead than it’s worth. Not because the model can’t help — but because making the help *practical* requires too much of *you*.

And that’s the real drag. You feel the potential, but the lift is still too high.

That’s why this chapter stops where it does. We’re not showing you how to build the whole machine. Not yet. But we are starting to name what’s needed.

Later, we’ll walk through how to hire and manage **virtuals** — modular AI workers that don’t just answer questions, but fill a role. They show up in context. They produce tangible outputs. They can take a waypoint and move the bead.

That’s where things get interesting.

Because what used to take a full dev team, a custom backend, and months of planning… starts to look tractable. If you know what seat needs filling — and how to hand it the work.

## The Bead and the Cups

Zoom out. Imagine the entire SOP as a series of cups, each holding a portion of the work. The “ticket” — your client’s request, your planning brief — is the bead. It moves from one cup to the next as each step is completed.

That bead is the thing you’re actually tracking. It’s the locus of progress. The artifacts, the decisions, the handoffs — all of it exists to help that bead move. And that’s the game we’re playing: **get the bead to the next cup**.

That’s what context engineering is about.

It’s about giving the AI the right window into the bead’s state — the right context — so it can perform the next microtask. Nothing more. Nothing less. You’re not asking it to plan the trip in one leap. You’re asking it to move the bead one cup forward. One step. One artifact. One meaningful contribution.

Because when you break it down that way, the work becomes tractable.

You’re not facing the whole elephant. You’re taking one bite.

## What’s Next

That’s where we’re headed now.

First, we’ll revisit the principle of **One Volley at a Time** — because this is the rhythm that makes complex systems possible. Then we’ll get sharper about **Context Engineering**, which is how you keep each handoff clean.

But before we move on, take one last look at the process we just exposed.

That wasn’t busywork. It was *the work* — reifying a process, mapping its phases, identifying its artifacts. Now you know what success looks like. Now you know what needs to exist. Now you can start imagining what it would take to make the machine move the bead on its own.

We’re not doing that yet.

But we’re ready to start thinking like someone who might.
