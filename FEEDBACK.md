# Feedback

This is a working draft about 2/3 done—still in need of editing and likely to change. But the material, and the shape the ideas are starting to take, felt worth sharing. Other priorities are pulling focus right now, so it may be a while before I can return to it. In the meantime, feedback is welcome—with a few caveats.

There are pop culture references throughout, some of them old. I included them to add color. If someone has to look up what a C-3PO is, that’s fine. Not everyone enjoys running into unfamiliar references, and that’s fair. But I made that choice knowingly.

Some parts are abstract by design. The goal isn’t to spell out technical details with precision—it’s to help certain ideas and ways of thinking land. That may feel a bit gray at times. That’s intentional.

The throughline is clarity of thought. If something feels off, unclear, or misrepresented, that’s useful to know. Writing isn’t my strong suit, and you’ll probably notice some chatbot fingerprints in here. But the ideas are mine. I hope they come through.
